# Install jenkins

Environment : CentOS

## Red Hat / CentOS

You can install Jenkins through yum on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and other Red Hat based distributions. You need to choose either the Jenkins Long Term Support release or the Jenkins weekly release.

**Step 1 : Long Term Support release**

A LTS (Long-Term Support) release is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. It can be installed from the redhat-stable yum repository.
