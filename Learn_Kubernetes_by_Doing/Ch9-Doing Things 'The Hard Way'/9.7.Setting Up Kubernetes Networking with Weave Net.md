# **Setting Up Kubernetes Networking with Weave Net**
## **Introduction**
In this lab, we'll configure a Kubernetes pod network using Weave Net. After completing the lab, you will have hands-on experience implementing networking within a Kubernetes cluster.

To start, open two terminal windows and log in to both worker nodes using the public IPs and credentials listed on the lab page. Note: We're going to run all the commands on both servers simultaneously throughout the entire lab.

## **Enable IP Forwarding on All Worker Nodes**
In order for Weave Net to work, we need to make sure IP forwarding is enabled on the worker nodes. Enable it by running the following on both workers:

```
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
    echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

## **Install Weave Net in the Cluster**
Log in to the controller server in a new terminal window, and then do the following:

1. Install Weave Net using a configuration from Weaveworks like this:

    
    ```
    kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')&env.IPALLOC_RANGE=10.200.0.0/16"
    ```
    
2. Verify that everything is working:
    ```
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    ```

    This should return two `weave-net` pods and look something like this:

    ```
    NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    weave-net-m69xq   2/2       Running   0          11s
    weave-net-vmb2n   2/2       Running   0          11s
    ```

3. Spin up some pods to test the networking functionality:

    a. First, create an Nginx deployment with 2 replicas:

    ```
    cat << EOF | kubectl apply --kubeconfig admin.kubeconfig -f -
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       metadata:
         name: nginx
       spec:
         selector:
           matchLabels:
             run: nginx
         replicas: 2
         template:
           metadata:
             labels:
               run: nginx
           spec:
             containers:
             - name: my-nginx
               image: nginx
               ports:
               - containerPort: 80
    EOF
    ```

    b. Next, create a service for that deployment so that we can test connectivity to services as well:

    ```
    kubectl expose deployment/nginx
    ```

    c. Start up another pod. We will use this pod to test our networking. We will test whether we can connect to the other pods and services from this pod.

    ```
    kubectl run busybox --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl --command -- sleep 3600
    
    POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l run=busybox -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    ```

    d. Get the IP addresses of our two `nginx` pods:

    ```
    kubectl get ep nginx
    ```

    There should be two IP addresses listed under `ENDPOINTS`. For example:

    ```
    NAME      ENDPOINTS                       AGE
    nginx     10.200.0.2:80,10.200.128.1:80   50m
    ```

4. Make sure the `busybox` pod can connect to the `nginx` pods on both of those IP addresses.

    ```
    kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- curl &lt;first nginx pod IP address&gt;
    
    kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- curl &lt;second nginx pod IP address&gt;
    ```

    Both commands should return some HTML with the title `"Welcome to Nginx!"` This means that we can successfully connect to other pods.

5. Now let's verify that we can connect to services.

    ```
    kubectl get svc
    ```

    This should display the IP address for our Nginx service. For example, in this case, the IP is `10.32.0.54`:

    ```
    NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
    kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.32.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   1h
    nginx        ClusterIP   10.32.0.54   <none>        80/TCP    53m
    ```

6. Check that we can access the service from the `busybox` pod.
    
    ```
    kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- curl &lt;nginx service IP address&gt;
    ```

    This should also return HTML with the title `"Welcome to nginx!"`

Getting this response means that we have successfully reached the Nginx service from inside a pod and that our networking configuration is working!
