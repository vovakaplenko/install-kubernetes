# **Creating a Service and Discovering DNS Names in Kubernetes**
We have been given a three-node cluster. Within that cluster, we must perform the following tasks in order to create a service and resolve the DNS names for that service. We will create the necessary Kubernetes resources in order to perform this DNS query.

To adequately complete this hands-on lab, we must have a working deployment, a working service, and be able to record the DNS name of the service within our Kubernetes cluster.

Log in to the Kube Master server using the credentials on the lab page (either in your local terminal, using the Instant Terminal feature, or using the public IP), and work through the objectives listed.

## **Create an nginx deployment, and verify it was successful.**
1. Use this command to create an nginx deployment:

        kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
- Use this command to verify deployment was successful:

        kubectl get deployments

## **Create a service, and verify the service was successful.**
1. Use this command to create a service:

        kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type NodePort
- Use this command to verify the service was created:
        
        kubectl get services

## **Create a pod that will allow you to query DNS, and verify itâ€™s been created.**
1. Using an editor of your choice (e.g., Vim and the command **vim busybox.yaml**), enter the following YAML to create the busybox pod spec:

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
        name: busybox
        spec:
        containers:
        - image: busybox:1.28.4
            command:
            - sleep
            - "3600"
            name: busybox
        restartPolicy: Always
- Use the following command to create the busybox pod:

        kubectl create -f busybox.yaml
- Use the following command to verify the pod was created successfully:

        kubectl get pods

## **Perform a DNS query to the service.**
1. Use the following command to query the DNS name of the nginx service:

        kubectl exec busybox -- nslookup nginx

## **Record the DNS name.**
1. Record the name of:

        &lt;service-name&gt.default.svc.cluster.local
