# **Using Init Containers in Kubernetes**
## **Introduction**
Init containers are a great way to customize container startup. This lab will allow you to test your knowledge of init containers by using them to solve problems in an existing Kubernetes cluster.

## **Solution**
Log in to the provided lab server using the credentials provided:

    ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
### **Create a Sample Pod That Uses an Init Container to Delay Startup**
1. Open the pod descriptor file:

    vi pod.yml
2. Add an init container (at the same level as containers in the file) to delay startup until the shipping-svc service is available:

        spec:
        ...
        initContainers:
        - name: shipping-svc-check
            image: busybox:1.27
            command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup shipping-svc; do echo waiting for shipping-svc; sleep 2; done']

3. Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

4. Create the pod:

        kubectl create -f pod.yml
5. Check the status of the pod:

        kubectl get pods
    It should remain in the Init status.

### **Test Your Setup by Creating the Service and Verifying the Pod Starts Up**
1. Create the service from the shipping-svc.yml file:

        kubectl create -f shipping-svc.yml
2. Check the status of your pod again:

        kubectl get pods
    It should enter the Running status after about a minute.

## **Conclusion**
Congratulations on successfully completing this hands-on lab!
