# **Assigning a Kubernetes Pod to a Specific Node**
## **Introduction**
Kubernetes scheduling usually doesn't need much help in order to determine which node to run a pod on. However, you may occasionally wish to have a little more control. In this lab, you will be able to practice the process of ensuring a pod runs on a specific node.

## **Solution**
Log in to the lab server using the credentials provided:

    ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
### **Configure the auth-gateway Pod to Only Run on k8s-worker2**
1. Attach a label to **k8s-worker2**.

        kubectl label nodes k8s-worker2 external-auth-services=true
2. Open auth-gateway.yml:

        vi auth-gateway.yml
3. Add a nodeSelector to the auth-gateway pod descriptor:

        ...

        spec:
        nodeSelector:
            external-auth-services: "true"

        ...
4. Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

5. Delete and re-create the pod:

        kubectl delete pod auth-gateway -n beebox-auth
        
        kubectl create -f auth-gateway.yml
6. Verify the pod is scheduled on the k8s-worker2 node:

        kubectl get pod auth-gateway -n beebox-auth -o wide

### **Configure the auth-data Deployment's Replica Pods to Only Run on k8s-worker2**
1. Open auth-data.yml:

        vi auth-data.yml
2. Add a nodeSelector to the pod template in the deployment spec (it will be the second spec in the file):

        ...

        spec:

        ...

        template:

            ...

            spec:
            nodeSelector:
                external-auth-services: "true"

            ...
3. Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

4. Update the deployment:

        kubectl apply -f auth-data.yml
5. Verify the deployment's replicas are all running on k8s-worker2:

        kubectl get pods -n beebox-auth -o wide

## **Conclusion**
Congratulations on successfully completing this hands-on lab!
