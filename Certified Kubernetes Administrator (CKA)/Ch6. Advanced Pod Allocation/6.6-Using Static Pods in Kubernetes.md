# **Using Static Pods in Kubernetes**
## **Introduction**
Static pods are a great way to run a pod on a single node without the involvement of the Kubernetes control plane. In this lab, you will have a chance to exercise your knowledge of static pods by creating them in an existing cluster.

### **Create a Manifest for a Static Pod**
1. Log in to the Worker Node 1 server:

        ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
2. Create a static pod manifest file:

        [cloud_user@k8s-worker1]$ sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/beebox-diagnostic.yml
3. Add the following into the file:

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
        name: beebox-diagnostic
        spec:
        containers:
        - name: beebox-diagnostic
            image: acgorg/beebox-diagnostic:1
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
4. Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

### **Start Up the Static Pod**
1. Restart kubelet to start the static pod:

        [cloud_user@k8s-worker1]$ sudo systemctl restart kubelet
2. In a new terminal session, log in to the Control Plane Node server:

        ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
3. Check the status of your static Pod:

        [cloud_user@k8s-control]]$ kubectl get pods
4. Attempt to delete the static Pod using the k8s API:

        [cloud_user@k8s-control]]$ kubectl delete pod beebox-diagnostic-k8s-worker1
5. Check the status of the Pod:

        [cloud_user@k8s-control]]$ kubectl get pods
    We'll see the Pod was immediately re-created, since it is only a mirror Pod created by the worker kubelet to represent the static Pod.

## **Conclusion**
Congratulations on successfully completing this hands-on lab!
