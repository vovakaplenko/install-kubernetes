# **Using DaemonSets in Kubernetes**
## **Introduction**
DaemonSets are a great way to ensure a pod replica runs dynamically on each node. They even automatically handle the creation and removal of such pods when nodes join or leave the cluster. In this lab, you will have the opportunity to practice your skills with DaemonSets by using them to run pods on all nodes in an existing cluster.

## **Solution**
Log in to the lab server using the credentials provided:

    ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>

### **Create a DaemonSet Specification YAML File**
1. Create a DaemonSet descriptor:

        vi daemonset.yml
2. Add the following to the file:

        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: DaemonSet
        metadata:
        name: beebox-cleanup
        spec:
        selector:
            matchLabels:
            app: beebox-cleanup
        template:
            metadata:
            labels:
                app: beebox-cleanup
            spec:
            containers:
            - name: busybox
                image: busybox:1.27
                command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do rm -rf /beebox-temp/*; sleep 60; done']
                volumeMounts:
                - name: beebox-tmp
                mountPath: /beebox-temp
            volumes:
            - name: beebox-tmp
                hostPath:
                path: /etc/beebox/tmp
3. Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

### **Create the DaemonSet in the Cluster**
1. Create the DaemonSet in the cluster:

        kubectl apply -f daemonset.yml
2. Get a list of pods, and verify a DaemonSet pod is running on each worker node:

        kubectl get pods -o wide

## **Conclusion**
Congratulations on successfully completing this hands-on lab!
