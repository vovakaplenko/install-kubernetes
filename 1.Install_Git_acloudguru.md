# Use Git to Make Changes to Code

In this lab, we will make a change to the train-schedule app. Instead of the app's main page header reading "Train Schedule," the customer wants it to read “Find your train!” This text can be found in the project file views/index.jade on GitHub.

You can find the file here.

## Install Git

To push a change to the code, you will need to:

Install git:

    sudo yum -y install git    

    git --version


Configure the name and email address associated with git:

git config --global user.name "<YOUR NAME>"

    git config --global user.name "ymlee4953"

git config --global user.email "<YOUR EMAIL>"

    git config --global user.email "ymlee4953@gmail.com"

Create an SSH key, using the default settings:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    
Display the contents of our new public key (be sure to copy the key to your clipboard):

cat /home/cloud_user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Log in to GitHub, navigate to Settings, click on SSH and GPG keys, and click on New SSH Key. Paste your public key information into this field and then click Add SSH key.

Create a Fork
Create a personal fork of the sample repository https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-git.

Navigate to the URL https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-git
Click Fork in the top-right of the page.
Clone your personal fork from GitHub.

Click the green Clone or download button and copy the string that is displayed
In your terminal, run the following command:

cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:whboyd/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-git.git
cd cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-git/
Create a feature branch to contain the change:

git checkout -b myBranch
Change the header text in views/index.jade from “Train Schedule” to “Find your train!”:

vim views/index.jade
Add the change in views/index.jade to the next commit:

git add .
Commit the change:

git commit -m "<UNIQUE MESSAGE>"
Push the Commit
Push the change to the remote SCM repository:

git config --global push.default simple
git push --set-upstream origin myBranch
Create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the master branch:

On the GitHub fork page, click Branches, locate myBranch under Your branches, and click New pull request.
In the top-left of the new pull request, change the base fork dropdown menu to your personal fork.
Click Create pull request
Merge the pull request

After a few moments, click the Merge pull request button
Click Confirm merge
The change is pushed.

Conclusion
We have installed Git, created a fork of a file, edited to fulfill our needs, and have pushed the change. Congratulations on completing this lab!
